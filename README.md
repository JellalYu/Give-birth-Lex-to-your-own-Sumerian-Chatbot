## Scenario
Amazon Sumerian is an AWS service for creating 3D applications that support AR and VR services. It can be applied to the product presentation in various scenarios. You can also build a chatbot in Amazon Sumerian. 
Based on the [**previous Lab**](https://github.com/JellalYu/Create-a-Comprehend-Translate-Chatbot-in-Lex), this Lab combined amazon Sumerian and Polly to create a more interactive chatbot.

## Lab Tutorial

### Create a Cognito identity pool ID
Before we get to editing a scene in Sumerian, we need to set up an AWS Cognito identity.

1.    Sign in to Amazon with your AWS account and open **Cognito**.
2.    Type **Manage identity Pools**.
3.    In Federated identities page, click **Create new identity Pool**.
4.    In Getting started wizard page, enter your own identity pool name and check the **Enable access to unauthenticated identities** box.

### Add State machine
Here, we will establish the Sumerian Chatbot behavior flow through the state machine, and it will take actions according to this setting.

1. Add **State machine**.

2. In State machine, rename the **behavior name** to "Chatbot_beh" and rename the **Selected State** to "Start".

![12.PNG](/Imgs/12.PNG)

3. Choose **Add Action**, and then search for and add the **AWS SDK Ready** action.

7. Add **Process with Lex** State.
This state can input Sumerian's chat process to Lex and get a reply result

![18.PNG](/Imgs/18.PNG)

8. Add **Play Response** State.
This state can connect the output of Lex to polly and speak with Sumerian interfaces

![19.PNG](/Imgs/19.PNG)

9. Add **Adding Transitions** State.
So far, there are many states, and we can simply connect them with the state machine.

![20.PNG](/Imgs/20.PNG)

10. Set the **Start** and state to **Set As Initial State**.

3. Paste the following code:

```
<style>
     /*
      * Place your styles here. Beware that CSS styles affect all
      * HTML elements in the page, so you need to provide appropriate
      * classes or IDs to identify the element being styled.
      */

     #lexInput {
         background: #fefefe;
         font-size: 16px;
         padding: 10px;
         border-radius: 3px;
         margin: 0;
         font-family: sans-serif;
         width: 250px;
     }
 </style>

 <input type="text" id="lexInput"/>
```
